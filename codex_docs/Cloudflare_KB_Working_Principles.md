# Cloudflare KB Working Principles

1. **Verify with canonical docs:** Treat Cloudflare developer documentation as the single source of truth for every statement.
2. **Record provenance:** Capture citations with titles, URLs, and accessed dates for each fact block.
3. **Prefer structured data:** Align notes, examples, and limits with the defined schemas to keep downstream validation simple.
4. **Document disagreements:** Flag mismatches between caches and docs using `status: "disputed"` and explain the gap.
5. **Optimize for reuse:** Write concise, modular content so later agents can import snippets without extra cleanup.
