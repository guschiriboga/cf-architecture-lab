# Cloudflare KB Citations

Use this YAML snippet for each `sources` entry:

```yaml
- url: https://developers.cloudflare.com/<product>/<page>/
  title: "Page title"
  accessed: "2025-01-15"
  note: "Context or limit referenced"
```

**Dispute rule:** When cached data conflicts with canonical docs, keep both facts, mark the record `status: "disputed"`, and cite the official page explaining the disagreement.
