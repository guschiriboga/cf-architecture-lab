# Cloudflare KB Validation Checklist

1. **Schema validation:** Run automated checks for product, interaction, and limits artifacts before submission.
2. **Citation audit:** Confirm every fact carries a `sources` entry with URL, title, accessed date, and optional note.
3. **Limits verification:** Cross-check all limits and free-tier entries against canonical documentation.
4. **Interaction consistency:** Ensure referenced product IDs exist and relationships align with schema expectations.
5. **Change log review:** Record validation results and outstanding issues in `codex_docs/validation_notes.md`.
