# Template: Minimal Worker

A minimal Worker scaffold with Wrangler configuration placeholders.

## Files
- `wrangler.toml` – Fill with your account_id, routes, and bindings.
- `src/index.js` – Hello World + healthcheck.

> **Note:** This is intentionally minimal; fill bindings when the service pages are finalized.
