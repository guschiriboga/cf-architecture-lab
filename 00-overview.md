# Handbook Overview

This repository organizes **Cloudflare** services into a concise, versioned handbook. We keep **facts verified** via official docs and **templates minimal** for rapid bootstrapping.

## Conventions
- Every limit/pricing claim must be backed by Cloudflare **official documentation** and an access date in commit notes or page footers.
- Canonical numbers live in `data/services.yaml` so we can generate tables consistently.
- When limits change, update the YAML and regenerate the matrix rather than editing many pages manually.
