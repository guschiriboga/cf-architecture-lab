capabilities:
  - Upload, store, and serve images directly from Cloudflare's global network while defining up to 100 named variants per asset for responsive delivery.
  - Optimize remote images with transformation URLs or Workers integrations that apply resizing, format conversion, and caching without copying originals.
  - Accept end-user uploads securely through one-time direct upload URLs and enforce access with signed delivery tokens.
how_it_works:
  model: Cloudflare Images keeps a canonical original in Cloudflare storage or a remote origin, generates transformed variants on demand, and serves them via the imagedelivery.net CDN.
  architecture:
    - Upload APIs and direct creator uploads create image records that reference the original asset and expose variant identifiers for delivery.
    - Edge transformations run when a variant or transformation URL is requested, pulling the original, applying requested operations, and caching the output across Cloudflare's network.
    - Access control layers rely on signed URL tokens and optional Worker logic to gate retrieval of private assets while still serving public variants efficiently.
  execution:
    - Clients or Workers call the Images API to upload files, either directly or through one-time direct upload endpoints that produce expiring URLs for browsers.
    - Transformation URLs embed directives like width, format, and fit, allowing the Images service to transform the requested asset and cache the result for subsequent requests.
    - Workers can intercept unsigned requests, generate signed delivery URLs with configurable expirations, and redirect clients to authorized variants.
  consistency:
    - Cached transformations are counted once per 30-day window, ensuring the same variant request reuses existing renders and billing records.
    - Direct upload drafts can be inspected through the API until the creator completes an upload, providing clear state transitions for asynchronous workflows.
    - Variant definitions stored with each image apply globally, so updating a variant instantly changes the transformation applied for every request.
supported_languages:
  runtimes:
    - Cloudflare Workers runtime for server-side image orchestration and signed URL generation.
    - Any HTTPS-capable client for invoking the Images REST API endpoints.
  sdks:
    - name: Cloudflare Images API (REST)
      url: https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/images/
  notes:
    - Delivery URLs use the imagedelivery.net domain structure, which can be generated server-side or stored as links in applications.
usage_patterns:
  webpages:
    - pattern: Serve responsive images from existing origins with transformation URLs.
      steps:
        - Enable transformations for the target zone in the dashboard.
        - Construct URLs that include width, format, or other directives to request optimized variants.
        - Embed the transformation URLs in page markup so Cloudflare caches and serves each variant globally.
  one_tier_apps:
    - pattern: Accept user uploads without exposing API tokens.
      steps:
        - Request a direct upload URL from the Images API with requireSignedURLs enabled.
        - Return the upload URL to the browser to post the selected file directly to Cloudflare.
        - Monitor the image draft status via the API and publish signed delivery URLs after upload completion.
  multi_tier_apps:
    - pattern: Pipeline user uploads through Workers, Images, and R2 storage.
      steps:
        - Bind Images, R2, and Assets to a Worker project via wrangler configuration.
        - Stream uploaded files through the Worker, applying Images transformations such as overlays or format conversion.
        - Store the transformed result in R2 and surface the delivery URL or stored object to downstream systems.
interactions:
  produces_bindings:
    - images
  consumes_bindings:
    - workers
    - r2
  best_with:
    - product_id: workers
      reason: Workers supply transformation logic, signed URL generation, and routing control for delivering private or custom image flows.
    - product_id: r2
      reason: Images tutorials highlight storing transformed assets in R2 buckets while Images handles optimization and delivery.
  anti_patterns:
    - Attempting to deliver large binary assets above the 25 MiB site asset limit without offloading to storage products like R2.
limits:
  quotas:
    - name: Included unique transformations
      value: 5000 per month
      scope: Per account
      plan: Images Free
  performance:
    - name: Transformation caching window
      value: 30 days per unique transformation
      scope: Global cache
      note: Images counts each transformation once in a rolling 30-day period before billing again.
  constraints:
    - name: Stored image file size
      value: 10 MB maximum per upload
      note: Uploaded images kept in the Images storage bucket cannot exceed 10 MB.
    - name: Transformation input size
      value: 70 MB input, 100 megapixel area limit
      note: Remote transformation requests must stay under the size and area limits enforced by Images.
    - name: Variant count per image
      value: Up to 100 named variants
      note: Each image can define 100 variants describing target resizing or formatting behaviors.
    - name: Direct upload URL expiry
      value: 30 minutes default, up to 6 hours
      note: One-time upload URLs expire after 30 minutes unless extended to a six-hour maximum.
free_tier:
  items:
    - name: Included unique transformations
      value: 5000
      reset_window: Monthly
      scope: Per account
  notes:
    - Cached variants continue serving after the free quota is reached, but new transformations return error 9422 until you upgrade or the window resets.
security_compliance:
  authz:
    - Signed URL tokens restrict access to private images, preventing downloads without a valid signature.
    - Direct creator uploads rely on one-time URLs that keep API tokens and credentials off client devices.
  isolation:
    - Cloudflare sanitizes SVG files before delivery to remove scripting, hyperlinks, and cross-origin references.
  data_residency:
    - Images are delivered from Cloudflare's global network, minimizing latency regardless of viewer geography.
  secrets:
    uses:
      - API tokens generated in the dashboard authenticate upload, variant, and management requests.
configuration:
  wrangler:
    bindings:
      - type: images
        key: IMAGES
        note: Bind the Images API to Workers when transforming or delivering assets in code.

dev_experience:
  local_dev:
    - Use Workers locally to generate signed URLs and preview transformation logic before deploying.
  testing:
    - Query direct upload drafts via the API to confirm that creator uploads completed successfully.
  ci_cd:
    - Include Images API calls in deployment pipelines to seed or update required variants alongside application releases.
migration_versioning:
  versioning:
    - Maintain variant definitions in configuration so updates change every delivery URL consistently.
  migrations:
    - Update or recreate variants via the API whenever image sizing requirements evolve to refresh cached content.
cost_awareness:
  metering:
    - Unique transformations are counted once within a 30-day rolling window and incur charges beyond the included quota on paid plans.
  design_tips:
    - Reuse named variants across pages and assets to reduce redundant transformations and control costs.
