summary: Cloudflare SSL/TLS encrypts web traffic with automatically issued certificates and configurable TLS policies so every proxied hostname can use HTTPS.

capabilities:
  - Provide free Domain Validated certificates for every activated zone through Universal SSL.
  - Issue customizable certificates with preferred hostnames, CAs, and validation workflows via Advanced Certificate Manager.
  - Delegate domain control validation for partial zones so Cloudflare can complete issuance steps on your behalf.
  - Enforce minimum TLS versions and adjust cipher suites to meet security requirements.
how_it_works:
  model: Cloudflare provisions and renews edge certificates, then terminates HTTPS connections at the edge before proxying traffic to origins.
  architecture:
    - Universal SSL automatically issues and renews DV certificates for every activated domain on Cloudflare.
    - Advanced Certificate Manager lets customers order certificates that cover additional hostnames, choose CAs, and control validation and trust stores.
    - Minimum TLS settings define the lowest TLS protocol version visitors must use and can be applied zone-wide or per hostname.
  execution:
    - Customers enable Universal SSL or request advanced certificates through the dashboard workflows.
    - For partial setups, administrators supply DCV tokens or use Delegated DCV so Cloudflare can validate hostnames.
    - TLS policies are configured by selecting the desired minimum version in the dashboard or via the min_tls_version API setting.
  consistency:
    - Cloudflare renews Universal SSL certificates automatically, keeping coverage for all proxied hostnames.
    - Delegated DCV reduces manual validation for advanced certificates by letting Cloudflare complete the process.
    - Per-hostname minimum TLS controls require Advanced Certificate Manager and apply consistently across specified hosts.

  notes:
    - SSL/TLS features are managed in the Cloudflare dashboard or via zone settings API endpoints.
usage_patterns:
  webpages:
    - pattern: Protect a new zone with Universal SSL.
      steps:
        - Add and activate the domain on Cloudflare.
        - Confirm Universal SSL is enabled so certificates issue automatically.
        - Serve traffic through Cloudflare to use the edge certificates.
  one_tier_apps:
    - pattern: Customize certificates for SaaS or multi-subdomain deployments.
      steps:
        - Purchase Advanced Certificate Manager for the zone.
        - Order a certificate that includes required subdomains and preferred CA or validity period.
        - Enable Total TLS or delegated DCV to keep subdomain certificates current.
  multi_tier_apps:
    - pattern: Enforce higher TLS standards across multiple hostnames.
      steps:
        - Set the minimum TLS version for the zone using the dashboard or API.
        - For sensitive hostnames, set per-hostname minimum versions through the Advanced Certificate Manager API.
        - Review compatibility requirements before raising protocol versions to avoid client access issues.

  best_with:
    - product_id: dns
      reason: Cloudflare DNS works with SSL/TLS to route traffic to proxied hostnames using the issued certificates.
    - product_id: cloudflare_for_saas
      reason: SaaS providers extend SSL/TLS coverage to customer domains using Advanced Certificate Manager and Total TLS.
  anti_patterns:
    - Attempting to disable TLS 1.0 without verifying client support for newer protocols, which can block older devices.

  notes:
    - Universal SSL and minimum TLS controls are available on every Cloudflare plan, while advanced options require add-ons.
