capabilities:
  - Provide Zero Trust access, secure web gateway filtering, remote browser isolation, CASB, DLP, and email security from a unified Cloudflare One dashboard.
  - Connect self-hosted applications and private networks through Cloudflare Tunnel with outbound-only `cloudflared` connectors that keep origins off the public Internet.
  - Protect managed and unmanaged devices with the Cloudflare WARP client to enforce Gateway policies, device posture, and contextual access checks anywhere users work.
how_it_works:
  model: Cloudflare One delivers a secure access service edge built on Cloudflare's globally distributed connectivity cloud so traffic is connected, inspected, and filtered near every user.
  architecture:
    - Outbound-only Cloudflare Tunnel connections run `cloudflared` processes that maintain multiple encrypted links to Cloudflare data centers and route traffic to published hostnames or private networks.
    - Secure Web Gateway policies inspect DNS, network, HTTP, and egress traffic with a single policy engine, while Access evaluates layered rules for identity, device posture, mTLS, and service tokens.
    - Device clients connect through WARP using WireGuard or MASQUE tunnels and DNS-over-HTTPS proxies so Zero Trust policies apply consistently across operating systems.
  execution:
    - Administrators create remote tunnels in Cloudflare One, install the suggested `cloudflared` command on connectors, and publish application hostnames or CIDR ranges to route private traffic.
    - Teams define Access policies with allow, block, bypass, or service-auth actions plus include, require, and exclude rules to govern who reaches protected applications.
    - Users enroll devices with the WARP GUI or `warp-cli`, authenticate with their team name, and connect to apply Gateway traffic policies and Access posture checks.
  consistency:
    - Access evaluates bypass and service-auth policies before allow and block rules, stopping once a decision is made to keep enforcement deterministic.
    - Gateway policy updates propagate globally within about a minute, ensuring filtering remains in sync across Cloudflare data centers.
    - Scoped API tokens and optional read-only dashboard mode keep configuration changes centralized through automation.
supported_languages:
  runtimes:
    - Cloudflare WARP clients for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and ChromeOS send device traffic through Zero Trust controls.
    - The `cloudflared` connector runs on Linux, macOS, Windows, and Docker containers to maintain outbound tunnels.
  sdks:
    - name: Cloudflare Terraform Provider
      url: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs
  notes:
    - Use `warp-cli` on desktop platforms to script device enrollment, token-based registration, and connections for automation.
usage_patterns:
  webpages:
    - pattern: Publish a self-hosted web app through Cloudflare Tunnel and Access.
      steps:
        - Create a remotely managed tunnel, install the provided `cloudflared` command, and register the connector.
        - Define a published hostname or path that maps to the internal service origin.
        - Attach Access allow policies that require approved identities or service tokens before granting entry.
  one_tier_apps:
    - pattern: Enforce SaaS and Internet browsing controls with Gateway and WARP.
      steps:
        - Deploy the WARP client to devices and require users to authenticate with the team name.
        - Configure DNS, HTTP, network, and egress policies that match acceptable use and threat intelligence.
        - Monitor detections and adjust policy order or resolver settings as needed.
  multi_tier_apps:
    - pattern: Secure hybrid networks and private services with Tunnel plus Zero Trust policies.
      steps:
        - Install `cloudflared` near each private segment and publish CIDR ranges for remote access.
        - Require devices to connect through WARP so Gateway traffic inspection and Access posture checks apply to private routes.
        - Use DEX tests and remote captures to verify application reachability and troubleshoot segmented networks.

  anti_patterns:
    - Allowing Access bypass policies for Everyone leaves applications unprotected and should be avoided outside targeted exceptions.

      value: "100"
      reset_window: Daily
      scope: Zero Trust Free account
  notes:
    - Zero Trust Free and Pay-as-you-go plans include predefined financial and identifier DLP profiles along with payload logging and false positive reporting.
security_compliance:
  authz:
    - Access actions can require specific identity providers, device posture checks, mTLS certificates, or service tokens before granting application access.
    - Scoped API tokens let teams automate Zero Trust configuration without over-privileging other Cloudflare services.
  isolation:
    - WARP keeps device traffic inside authenticated tunnels so Gateway and Access policies follow users regardless of network location.
  data_residency:
    - Cloudflare's connectivity cloud operates within ~50 ms of most Internet users, inspecting traffic near its source across hundreds of cities.
  secrets:
    uses:
      - Device and connector enrollments rely on short-lived tokens, team names, and API credentials managed through the dashboard or Terraform automations.
configuration:
  wrangler:
    bindings: []
    example: Configuration changes can be centralized through API or Terraform workflows with the dashboard set to read-only for Zero Trust accounts.
  cli:
    commands:
      - warp-cli registration new <TEAM_NAME>
      - warp-cli connect
      - brew install cloudflared
      - winget install --id Cloudflare.cloudflared
  api:
    endpoints: []
dev_experience:
  local_dev:
    - Use WARP connectivity status messages to confirm enrollment progress during manual device setup.
  testing:
    - Run DEX tests and remote captures to validate application reachability through Access, Gateway, and Tunnel configurations.
  ci_cd:
    - Enforce read-only dashboards and apply scoped API tokens so Zero Trust policy updates flow through Terraform or scripted API pipelines.
migration_versioning:
  versioning:
    - Enable read-only mode in the dashboard to ensure all Zero Trust changes are versioned through infrastructure-as-code workflows.
  migrations:
    - Deploy multiple `cloudflared` connectors per environment so tunnels fail over automatically while migrating applications or networks.
cost_awareness:
  metering:
    - Track application, policy, tunnel, and Logpush quotas to stay within documented account limits before requesting increases.
  design_tips:
    - Layer DNS, network, HTTP, and egress policies carefully instead of relying on broad bypass rules to avoid accidental exposure and inspection gaps.
