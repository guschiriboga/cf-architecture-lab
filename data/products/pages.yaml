      url: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/direct-upload/
    - title: Functions
      url: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/
capabilities:
  - Connect GitHub or GitLab repositories to run builds, preview deployments, and automatic production releases on every push.
  - Upload prebuilt assets from local or CI pipelines via Wrangler or dashboard drag and drop, deploying globally in minutes.
  - Extend sites with Pages Functions that run on the Workers runtime and integrate with platform resources through bindings.
how_it_works:
  model: Pages ingests source code or build artifacts, runs configurable build steps, and serves static assets plus edge functions from Cloudflare's network.
  architecture:
    - Git-integrated projects trigger builds from the configured production branch and create preview deployments for every other branch.
    - Direct Upload projects use Wrangler or dashboard uploads to create deployments without relying on a Git provider.
    - Pages Functions run alongside static content, using the Workers runtime with compatibility flags and middleware support.
  execution:
    - Teams authenticate with a Git provider or Wrangler, create a project, and configure build commands and output directories.
    - Build pipelines produce assets that Pages deploys to the `pages.dev` domain or custom domains with optional rollbacks and previews.
    - Functions folders or `_worker.js` files add dynamic routes that execute on Cloudflare's edge and can call bound services.
  consistency:
    - Rollbacks let operators instantly restore any successful production deployment from the dashboard.
    - Preview deployments give each branch an isolated URL so changes can be reviewed before promotion.
    - Environment bindings support separate production and preview credentials to keep integrations consistent across releases.
supported_languages:
  runtimes:
    - Static asset hosting for any framework output supported by the build pipeline.
    - Cloudflare Workers runtime powering Pages Functions with Node.js API compatibility.
  sdks:
    - name: Create Cloudflare (C3) CLI
      url: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3/
  notes:
    - The C3 CLI scaffolds framework starters and can deploy directly to Pages with the `--platform=pages` argument.
usage_patterns:
  webpages:
    - pattern: Continuous deployment from a Git repository.
      steps:
        - Connect the repository through the Git integration workflow.
        - Configure build commands and output directories in the dashboard.
        - Push commits to trigger preview builds and merge into the production branch for live releases.
  one_tier_apps:
    - pattern: Ship static assets from a custom build pipeline.
      steps:
        - Generate a build artifact in external CI.
        - Use `wrangler pages deploy <dir>` to upload the output directory.
        - Promote preview or production deployments and use rollbacks if an issue is detected.
  multi_tier_apps:
    - pattern: Add serverless logic and platform resources with Pages Functions.
      steps:
        - Create a `functions/` directory or `_worker.js` to define routes that run on the Workers runtime.
        - Configure bindings for KV, R2, Durable Objects, or D1 to access shared services.
        - Apply middleware like the Cloudflare Access plugin to validate requests before serving content.

  produces_bindings: []
  consumes_bindings:
    - kv
    - r2
    - durable_objects
    - d1
  best_with:
    - product_id: workers
      reason: Pages Functions reuse the Workers runtime to add server-side logic, middleware, and compatibility flags.
    - product_id: kv
      reason: Official bindings documentation highlights KV as a common storage option for Pages Functions.
    - product_id: cloudflare_one
      reason: The Pages plugin validates Access JWTs to secure protected routes.
  anti_patterns:
    - Attempting to switch a project between Git integration and Direct Upload workflows after creation, which requires recreating the project.
limits:
  quotas:
    - name: Builds per month (Free plan)
      value: 500
      scope: Per account
      plan: Free
    - name: Custom domains per project (Free)
      value: 100
      scope: Per project
      plan: Free
  performance:
    - name: Build timeout
      value: 20 minutes
      scope: Each build
      note: Git-integrated builds terminate after 20 minutes of execution.
  constraints:
    - name: Files per deployment (Direct Upload Wrangler)
      value: 20,000 files, 25 MiB each
      note: Wrangler uploads support up to 20,000 assets with a 25 MiB per-file limit.
    - name: Drag and drop limits
      value: 1,000 files, 25 MiB each
      note: Dashboard uploads cap file count and size as documented.
    - name: Function usage model
      value: Standard Workers usage
      note: Functions requests count against Workers plan quotas.
free_tier:
  items:
    - name: Included monthly builds
      value: 500
      reset_window: Monthly
      scope: Per account
    - name: Included custom domains
      value: 100
      reset_window: Continuous
      scope: Per project
  notes:
    - Exceeding build or domain limits requires upgrading to higher plans or requesting limit adjustments.
security_compliance:
  authz:
    - The Cloudflare Access Pages plugin validates Access JWTs before allowing protected requests to proceed.
    - Wrangler CLI commands require authentication before creating or deploying projects.
  isolation:
    - Preview deployments isolate branch-specific builds with unique URLs to keep testing traffic separated from production.
  data_residency:
    - Assets and functions run on Cloudflare's global network, minimizing latency worldwide.
  secrets:
    uses:
      - Environment variables and bindings store credentials for builds and runtime integrations across environments.
configuration:
  wrangler:
    bindings:
      - type: pages_project
        key: pages
        note: Wrangler caches project identifiers after `pages project create` for subsequent deploys.
    example: |
      npx wrangler pages project create
  cli:
    commands:
      - npm create cloudflare@latest -- --platform=pages
      - npx wrangler pages deploy <BUILD_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY>
      - npx wrangler pages project list
  api:
    endpoints:
      - method: PATCH
        path: /client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/pages/projects/{project_name}
        note: Update project settings such as the production branch.
dev_experience:
  local_dev:
    - Run `wrangler pages dev` to serve local builds with function bindings and preview environment variables.
  testing:
    - Use preview deployment URLs generated for each branch or pull request to validate changes before release.
  ci_cd:
    - Integrate Direct Upload commands into CI pipelines to push artifacts without manual dashboard steps.
migration_versioning:
  versioning:
    - Track build commands, root directories, and environment variables in repository configuration for reproducible builds.
  migrations:
    - Use rollbacks or redeploy previous commits when reverting breaking changes, ensuring instant production recovery.
cost_awareness:
  metering:
    - Functions consumption follows Workers plan billing while static hosting remains included in Pages plans.
  design_tips:
    - Optimize build pipelines to stay within time limits and prune unnecessary assets to respect file caps.
