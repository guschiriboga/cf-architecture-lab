summary: Magic Cloud Networking automates discovery of cloud networks and connects them to Cloudflare's connectivity cloud so you can manage hybrid and multi-cloud routing from one place.

capabilities:
  - Automatically discover cloud resources like VPCs, subnets, virtual machines, route tables, and routes.
  - Create VPN tunnels that connect public cloud networks to Magic WAN with minimal manual configuration.
  - Combine cloud networks with office and data center networks to grow a consistent multi-cloud architecture.
  - Provide a dashboard catalog of discovered resources for centralized management.
how_it_works:
  model: Cloud integrations authorize Cloudflare to query cloud provider inventories and configure network attachments that link those resources to Magic WAN.
  architecture:
    - After authorization, Magic Cloud Networking builds a catalog that lists discovered VPCs, subnets, VMs, and routing tables.
    - The service provisions VPN tunnels between cloud networks and Magic WAN so on-ramps can be created automatically.
    - Integrations operate per provider account so customers can onboard multiple accounts for the same cloud platform.
  execution:
    - Administrators create a provider integration in the Cloudflare dashboard and authorize Cloudflare to access the account.
    - Required IAM policies grant permissions for tasks such as managing transit gateway peering attachments and prefix lists.
    - Once access is granted, discovery runs automatically and the dashboard surfaces resources to connect and manage.
  consistency:
    - Integrations remain scoped to the accounts you authorize, allowing multiple provider accounts to be onboarded in parallel.
    - Magic Cloud Networking is currently in closed beta, so customers enroll via the request form before connecting environments.
    - Resource discovery begins automatically after credentials are validated, keeping the catalog up to date.

  notes:
    - The product is managed through the Cloudflare dashboard; no client SDK is required.
usage_patterns:
  webpages:
    - pattern: Inventory cloud networking resources before building connectivity policies.
      steps:
        - Request beta access and enable Magic Cloud Networking in the Cloudflare dashboard.
        - Add a cloud integration and authorize Cloudflare to read routing and VPC information.
        - Review the cloud resource catalog to understand available networks and routes.
  one_tier_apps:
    - pattern: Connect a single public cloud environment to Magic WAN.
      steps:
        - Create an AWS integration from the Cloud integrations workflow.
        - Apply the recommended IAM policy so Cloudflare can manage transit gateway peering and prefix lists.
        - Allow Magic Cloud Networking to create the VPN tunnel to Magic WAN automatically.
  multi_tier_apps:
    - pattern: Manage multiple provider accounts across hybrid environments.
      steps:
        - Repeat the integration workflow for each cloud account that hosts application tiers.
        - Use the catalog to align routes between office networks, data centers, and cloud VPCs.
        - Monitor discovered changes to keep cross-cloud connectivity consistent.

  best_with:
    - product_id: magic_wan
      reason: Magic Cloud Networking creates Magic WAN on-ramps to connect cloud networks.
    - product_id: cloudflare_one
      reason: Connected networks feed into Cloudflare One policies for secure access.
  anti_patterns:
    - Attempting to deploy without granting the required cloud permissions, which prevents discovery and tunnel creation.
